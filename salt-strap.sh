    salt-strap is a quick bootstrap script used to set up a salt minion.

	To install the salt minion, run the following
		
		./salt-strap.sh -i

	It is expected that you provide the ip address of your salt master as follows.

		./salt-strap.sh -m 10.0.70.19

	If you are using salt's key identity feature, you can also provide it as follows
	
		./salt-strap.sh -m 10.0.70.19 -f ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl:mn:op:12:34:45:56:67:78:89

	Ideally, you should run all steps at once
	
		./salt-strap.sh -i -m 10.0.70.19 -f ab:cd:ef:gh:ij:kl:mn:op:12:34:45:56:67:78:89
